# Insulin Hero (Rebuild)
> This project is a diabetic aid application, designed to help users better keep track of and manage their diabetes as either a type 1, type 2 or prediabetic individual. *
*The motivation for creating this project is to rebuild and improve upon my capstone project from Tech Elevator, as well as produce an open source solution designed to help people suffering from this particular affliction. I wish to implement features that have been well researched, helpful, and directly requested by people in my life who have diabetes or are prediabetic.*

Note: This is a rebuilt version of my final capstone at Tech Elevator. I wanted to rebuild this project in order to create numerous improvements that were cut out due to the previous version's two-week timeline, implement features that were more clearly defined and requested by people directly suffering from diabetes, and experiment with new technologies that we did not learn in the cohort, such as React.

This project is not complete, but I believe in quality over speed in this context. Throughout the project I will comment in areas that I think I can improve upon later. As I learn more, these areas will be revisited and optimized.

## General Information
- **Problem:** There are many applications for individuals to track diabetes and blood sugar from, but very few that are free, user-friendly, and simplified to exclusively the feature sets that have been defined as helpful by the community.
- **Purpose:**  The purpose of this application is to help these users track their blood sugar levels and gain predictions about where their blood sugar will be in the future, gain guidance on what they should be eating to more effectively manage their blood sugar based on glycemic load, and obtain new calculated doses of insulin in a simplified format.
- *Why I am doing this:* This project is both for my own personal practice, and to produce a small, free application that may genuinely help people.
